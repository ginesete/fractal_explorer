# FRACTAL EXPLORER

A small project used to learn a bit of Rust.
It displays a window with a fractal, that can be explored with mouse clicks:

* Left button click: center on point and zoom in
* Right button click: center on point and zoom our
* Middle button click: center on point

SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES: 
Linux and Mac: libsdl-dev

This was used in the Meetup group [Rust Barcelona](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Rust-Barcelona/), for an introductory session on the language.
